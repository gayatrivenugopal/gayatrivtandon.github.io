I am currently pursuing Ph.D. from Symbiosis International University, India,
on <b>Automated Lexical Simplification of Hindi Text</b>.
The objective is to improve the accessibility of text in Hindi by automating the identification 
of complex words and providing simpler alternatives to these words. A part of this research has been
funded by Symbiosis International University, and has been approved by the Independent Ethics Committee, Symbiosis International University.
