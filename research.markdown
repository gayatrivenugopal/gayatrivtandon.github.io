I am a learning professional who has transitioned from academia to
the industry.<br>
I have worked as a university faculty for nearly ten years,
with teaching expertise in the areas of 
programming and web technologies.
I am experienced in cooperative learning and instructional designing 
strategies for learning and assessment.<br>
I am currently pursuing Ph.D. from Symbiosis 
International University in a topic that lies at the
intersection of text accessibility, 
machine learning and natural language processing.
I have published research papers in 
international journals and conference proceedings, 
and delivered sessions on text simplification,
 and education technologies at 
 national and international events.<br>
 I am keen on creating engaging learning content and implementing diverse learning and 
 evaluation strategies in various types environments, be it instructor-led, virtual instructor-led, or asynchronous.
 I have currently reached the last phase of the Future Learning and 
 Development Leader certificate programme by KPMG, which is a course
  for people working in, or transitioning into a Learning and Development role in the industry.
