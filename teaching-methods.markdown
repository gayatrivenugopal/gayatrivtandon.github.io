I try to incorporate my knowledge of and interest in Instructional Designing and adult learning theories, in my sessions, wherein I explain basic concepts using a small story/scenario, to make the session more appealing. I also use Gagne's Nine Events of Instruction during my sessions.
A few other teaching methods are listed below:<br>

<i>Group Activities</i><br>
In order to conduct group activities, I created private channels on Teams, wherein each channel could be accessed only by the members enrolled in that channel. This served as breakout rooms. Each channel conducted their own meeting and I visited each channel to supervise the activity.<br><br>

<i>Hybrid Flipped Classroom</i><br>
The students were asked to view a certain portion of a video. They were required to follow the steps to complete a task as shown in the video. After completing the task, they were asked to upload the screenshots of their work. Post this activity, they were required to take a quiz consisting of multiple choice questions, based on the video they watched. The quiz was created on Moodle LMS. As the creator of the quiz, I could view an analysis of the results of the quiz that gave me an idea about the topics that the students were confident in, and also the topics that they struggled to understand.<br><br>

<i>Google Jamboard</i><br>
I used Google Jamboard and asked the students to write down the key terms associated with a concept that was taught to them in an earlier lecture. The students created sticky notes on the board and we went over the terms one by one which helped in summarising the concept.<br>
It was also used to implement the Muddiest Point activity wherein they were asked to mention one topic that they are least confident in. They were also asked to mention one topic that they were most confident in. I then used the former list to explain those topics in more detail with different examples.<br><br>

<i>Mentimeter</i><br>
I used mentimeter to gamify my sessions, wherein students attempt a quiz in various sessions with an objective to score high on a leaderboard.<br><br>

<i>Padlet</i><br>
I used Padlet to:
<ul>
 <li>share a summary of the topics (and sub-topics) covered in class.</li>
 <li>ask the students to create a question wall wherein they would write a few questions that they would ask an opponent in a hypothetical quiz, about a given set of topics covered in class.</li>
</ul>

<i>Voice Thread</i><br>
I used Voice Thread to create a podcast for a course. Students were asked to record an audio at the end of every week explaining, in brief, the concepts covered during the week.<br><br>

<i>Other Methods and Tools</i><br>
<ul>
 <li>Buzz Programming</li>
 <li>Peer Code Review</li>
 <li>Debugging Activities</li>
 <li>Ziplet for Exit Tickets</li>
 <li>Autodraw for Graphical Explanation of Concepts</li>
</ul>
