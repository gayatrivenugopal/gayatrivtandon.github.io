I am an animal lover. Feeding and spending time with homeless dogs and cats serves is a great stress buster for me.<br>
I believe that one should never neglect their mental and physical health. Fitness plays a big role in my life and I try to incorporate different forms of physical activity in my daily routine.<br>
I found peace in reading and art during the pandemic. Today, my walls are adorned with charcoal art, abstract art and macrame. I was a person who believed that I did not have an ounce of creativity in me. However, I realized that we should never believe the narratives that run in 
our heads. Our inner self is bound to suprise us if we give ourselves a chance.<br>
I am looking forward to travel more to experience different cultures and learn more about nature.
