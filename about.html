I am a learning professional who has transitioned from an academic to a corporate environment.
I have worked as a university faculty for nearly ten years,

programming and web technologies.
I am experienced in cooperative learning techniques and instructional designing 
strategies for learning and assessment.<br>
I am currently pursuing Ph.D. from Symbiosis
