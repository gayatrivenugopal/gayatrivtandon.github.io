I am a learning professional who has transitioned from a teaching role at a university to
the role of a curriculum manager in the industry.
I was a university faculty for nearly ten years,
with expertise in the areas of 
programming and web technologies.
I am experienced in using instructional designing 
strategies for learning and assessment.
I am currently pursuing Ph.D. from Symbiosis 
International University in a topic that lies at the
intersection of text accessibility, 
machine learning and natural language processing.
I have published research papers in 
international journals and conference proceedings, 
and delivered sessions on text simplification,
 and education technologies at 
 national and international events.
 I am keen on implementing diverse learning and 
 evaluation strategies in various types environments, be it instructor-led, virtual instructor-led, or asynchronous.
 I am also pursuing the Future Learning and 
 Development Leader certificate programme by KPMG.
